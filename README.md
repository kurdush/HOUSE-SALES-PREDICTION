# HOUSE-SALES-PREDICTION
* The goal for this project is to build an end to end solution or application that is capable of predicting the house prices better than individuals. Another motivation for this project is to implement similar solution at my workplace and help Investments and Residential team make data driven decisions.
* here the object is to discuss the major factors that affect housing price and make precise predictions for it. We use 22  explanatory variables including almost every aspect of residential homes in King county, Usa.
*  Methods of both statistical regression models and machine learning regression models are applied and further compared according to their performance to better estimate the final price of each house. 
*  The model provides price prediction based on similar comparables of peopleâ€™s dream houses, which allows both buyers and sellers to better negotiate home prices according to market trend.
